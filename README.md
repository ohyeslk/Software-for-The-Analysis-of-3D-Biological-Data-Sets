Software-for-The-Analysis-of-3D-Biological-Data-Sets
====================================================
This
project
is
the
creation
of
a
software
interface
and
data
processing
toolbox
tailored
to
the
specific
needs
of
a
neurobiology
research
group.
The
project
scope
and
requirements
were
set
in
collaboration
between
Cognition
and
Intelligent
Computing
Research
Institute
and
Laboratory
of
Student
Training
Innovation
Programs.
The
data
set
and
characterization
process
are
essential
to
the
research
conclusions
of
the
Sanqing
Huâ€™s
group
in
Computer
Science
Department.
The
data
set
is
a
sequence
of
grey
scale
2D
images
taken
from
a
confocal
microscope
at
different
depths.
The
process
of
characterizing
the
data
set
involves
segmentation
according
to
intensity
and
geometric
shape
within
a
unique
noise
environment
imposed
by
the
confocal
microscope.
Prior
to
my
project's
completion,
the
research
group
was
only
able
to
perform
this
analysis
manually
in
2D.
The
application
of
image
processing
techniques
to
this
biological
context
provides
value
to
the
researcher
by
improving
the
precision
and
accuracy
of
measurements
as
well
reducing
the
time
and
frustration
encountered
through
manual
data
characterization.
