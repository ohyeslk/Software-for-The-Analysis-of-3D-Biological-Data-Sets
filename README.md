This
project
is
the
creation
of
a
software
interface
and
data
processing
toolbox
tailored
to
the
specific
needs
of
a
neurobiology
research
group.
The
project
scope
and
requirements
were
set
in
collaboration
between
Cognition
and
Intelligent
Computing
Research
Institute
and
Laboratory
of
Student
Training
Innovation
Programs.
The
software
created
is
called
receptorToolsGUI
and
is
run
within
MATLAB,
utilizing
its
image
processing,
user
interface,
and
3D
rendering
functionalities.

Professor
Sanqing
Hu’s
lab
is
investigating
the
cellular
consequences
of
spinal
cord
injury
(SCI).
As
part
of
their
research,
they
have
begun
to
analyze
the
SCI-­‐induced
changes
in
sensitivity
to
serotonin
(5-­‐HT)
by
identifying
the
presence
of
serotonin
receptors.
The
serotonin
receptors
can
be
visualized
in
transverse
image
sections
of
a
spinal
cord
through
the
use
of
a
confocal
microscope.
The
images
are
spaced
closely
together
to
create
a
three-­‐dimensional
representation
of
a
short
segment
of
the
spinal
cord.
In
characterizing
the
presence
of
the
serotonin
receptors,
the
researchers
wanted
to
identify
potential
receptors
in
the
noise
environment
imposed
by
the
confocal
microscope.
Once
potential
receptors
were
identified,
their
volume
and
average
intensity
also
needed
to
be
determined.
The
lab
also
requested
that
the
3D
data
set
be
rendered
in
such
a
way
that
the
visualization
might
help
to
characterize
the
data
set.
